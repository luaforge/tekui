=( about : 1. About tekUI )=

tekUI is a small and freestanding graphical user interface (GUI)
toolkit written in Lua and C. It was initially developed for the X
Window System and can serve as a general-purpose GUI library for
desktop applications.

Its main focus is on rapid development of applications for
custom-made devices, often with a custom appearance and under
resource-constrained conditions, such as for embedded devices with a
display controller.

Being mostly written in the
[[Lua scripting language][http://www.lua.org/]], it is easily
extensible with new user interface elements, which can later be
rewritten in C. The creation of new styles and themes and fitting the
software to a new device are equally simple.

See below for a more detailed technical [[#overview]].

==( license : 1.1. License )==

TekUI is free software under the same license as Lua itself: It can
be used for both academic and commercial purposes at no cost, it
qualifies as Open Source software and its license is compatible with
the GPL. See [[copyright][copyright.html]].

==( status : 1.2. Status, requirements )==

TekUI is in alpha stage of development. It should compile and run out
of the box on Linux and FreeBSD. Display drivers are available for
X11 and [[DirectFB][http://www.directfb.org/]] (the latter being
untested on FreeBSD). See also [[TODO][todo.html]] for a list of
known bugs and missing features, and [[#requirements]] for a list of
required packages.

==( development :  1.3. Development model )==

If you find this software useful, you have probably arranged to fit
it to a certain device or application – submit your additions and we
will check them for inclusion to the public source code repository.
Regular developers are also welcome.

==( support : 1.4. Support and services )==

Vendors of commercial products can help advance the development by
assigning projects based on tekUI. Support and services for the
integration of tekUI as well as special versions, new display
drivers, custom classes etc. are available from the authors – see
below.

=( overview : 2. Technical overview )=

TekUI is not a binding to an existing GUI library, and it makes no
attempt to conform to the looks of a host's native GUI (although this
can be emulated to a certain degree – see below for details). The
implementation comes straight to the point, and it is comparatively
fast and resource-friendly, despite its script-heavy nature. Among
the benefits for developers are its transparency and modularity; in
particular, custom interface elements can be created with little
effort. Note, however, that the programming interfaces are nowhere
complete and fully stable yet, so be prepared for structural and API
changes.

==( features : 2.1. Selected features )==

 * Automatic layouting and scalability, themes
 * Font-sensitivity, support for antialiased fonts
 * Full Unicode (UTF-8) support
 * Allows for multi-windowed and fullscreen applications
 * Fully incremental refresh logic, backbuffers are not required
 * Concurrency thanks to inbuilt support for dispatching to
 coroutines
 * Supplied with a documentation system supporting tekUI's object
 model
 * Works with stock (double precision), single precision and
 integer versions of the Lua VM

=== Supported interface elements ===

 * Canvas (smoothly scrolling)
 * Checkmark
 * Directory lister (file chooser included)
 * Floating text
 * Gauge
 * Group (horizontal, vertical, grids, in pages, scrollable)
 * Handle, for group balancing
 * Image gadget (only vector images at the moment)
 * List, also multi-column and multi-selection
 * Menu (popup and window), also nested
 * Popup item, also nested
 * Popup list ('combo box')
 * Radio button
 * Slider
 * Spacer
 * Text gadget (and label), also multi-line
 * Text input (single line)

==( plans : 2.2. Plans for development and deployment )==

The only language currently supported for writing applications in is
Lua, and application programmers will have to use existing Lua
modules or create their own C bindings for communicating with their
host. (Fortunately, creating C bindings is an easy and
well-documented task in Lua, and the tekUI package contains numerous
examples.)

Our next development target is to fold the tekUI framework into a
freestanding C library, which enables applications to create
asynchronous GUI objects, communicating with their main program
using an application-level protocol. From this, we envision the
following benefits:

 * GUIs integrate smoothly even into I/O-burdened applications
 (clients, servers)
 * strict separation of GUI and functionality; the GUI runs in
 a thread or process of its own
 * Faulty GUI application code, as it is written in a safe language,
 cannot corrupt the heap or otherwise crash the device, even if it
 is without a MMU.

Lua would continue to act as the toolkit's internal scripting
language, which can be used for complex interconnections
between GUI elements as well as simple application tasks.

==( themes : 2.3. Themes )==

The only admission to a more common appearance is that tekUI tries to
import the color scheme found in a GTK+ configuration file. It can be
conveniently created in the KDE configuration panel; thus, if you are
using KDE and check the appropriate option, KDE, GTK+ and tekUI
applications can all share the same color scheme.

The current default theme tries to be as conservative and minimal as
possible. Custom themes can be created by modifying (or deriving
from) the Theme class.

==( clibrary : 2.4. C library )==

The C library is based on the [[TEKlib][http://www.teklib.org/]]
middleware project. All required modules are contained in tekUI's
source code distribution, to reduce the hassle of building and
installing the software.

The C library isolates from the host and provides a few
performance-critical routines. Rendering and input handling are
isolated in the form of display drivers, which allow for easy
exchangeability. Display drivers currently supported are for X11 and
[[DirectFB][http://www.directfb.org/]].

Aside from the display driver interface, the C library features
OS-like facilities such as portable threads and a timer device.
Depending on your application and its kind of deployment, it can be
extended with more input drivers, a virtual filesystem, file format
codecs, etc.

==( objectjmodel : 2.5. Lua, C and object model )==

Regardless whether classes are written in Lua or C, they share a
common, single-inheritance object model, which is determined by the
Lua virtual machine and provides a referencing scheme and automatic
memory management.

Most user interface elements are currently implemented in Lua, which
is beneficial for fast prototyping of custom classes and styles, and
generally in early stages of development.

==( documentation : 2.6. Documentation system )==

TekUI comes with a documentation generator supporting its own object
model. It is capable of generating a function reference and
hierarchical class index from specially crafted comments in the
source code. To regenerate the full documentation, invoke

  # make docs

Note that you need
[[LuaFileSystem][http://www.keplerproject.org/luafilesystem/]] for
the document generator to process the file system hierarchy.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

=( buildinstall : 3. Building and installing )=

==( requirements : 3.1. Requirements )==

Development libraries alongside with their tested versions (as of
this writing) are given below:

 * Lua-5.1.2
 * libX11-1.1.3 (for the x11 driver)
 * libXft-2.1.12 (for the x11 driver)
 * fontconfig-2.5.0 (for the x11 driver)
 * freetype-2.3.5 (for the x11 and dfb drivers)
 * DirectFB-0.9.25.1 (for the dfb driver)

LibXft and fontconfig are needed for building the x11 driver, but
tekUI falls back to the core X11 API if they are unavailable at
runtime. Additionally, for the
[[DirList][manual.html#tek.ui.class.dirlist]] class to work, an
installation of the
[[LuaFileSystem][http://www.keplerproject.org/luafilesystem/]]
package is needed.

==( buildenv : 3.2. Adjusting the build environment )==

This release has been tested on and should compile and run out of the
box on

 * Ubuntu Linux 7.10
 * FreeBSD 7.0
 * Gentoo Linux x86/2007.0, amd64/2006.0, amd64/2007.0

If building fails for you, you have to adjust the build environment,
which is located in the {{config}} file on the topmost directory
level. Supported build tools are {{gmake}} (common under Linux) and
{{pmake}} (common under FreeBSD).

'''FreeBSD note''': You need a Lua interpreter which is linked with
the {{-pthread}} option, as tekUI is using multithreaded code
in shared libraries, which are dynamically loaded by the interpreter.

==( building : 3.3. Building )==

To see all build targets, type

  # make help

The regular build procedure is invoked with

  # make all

==( installation : 3.4. Installation )==

Please note that for the x11 driver, a system-wide installation of
tekUI is not strictly required. Once it is built, it can be worked
with and developed against, as long as you stay in the top-level
directory of the distribution. All required modules and classes will
be found if programs are started from there, e.g.:

  # bin/demo.lua

If staying in the top-level directory is not desirable, then tekUI
must be installed globally. (The same applies if the dfb driver is
used, as its fonts and cursors will be searched only globally.)

By default, the installation paths are

 - {{/usr/local/lib/lua/5.1}}
 - {{/usr/local/share/lua/5.1}}

It is not unlikely that this is different from what is common for
your operating system, distribution or development needs, so be sure
to adjust these paths in the {{config}} file. The installation is
conveniently invoked with

  # sudo make install

---------------------------------------------------------------------

=( usersguide : 4. tekUI user's guide )=

==( helloworld : 4.1. Hello, World! )==

The GUI version of the "Hello, World!" program:

  #/usr/bin/env lua
  ui = require "tek.ui"
  ui.Application:new
  {
    Children =
    {
      ui.Window:new
      {
        Title = "Hello",
        Children =
        {
          ui.Text:new
          {
            Text = "_Hello, World!",
            Style = "button",
            Mode = "button",
          },
        },
      },
    },
  }:run()

As can be seen, tekUI allows a fully functional application to be
written in a single nested expression. The
[[manual.html#tek.ui : UI]] library comes with an on-demand class
loader, so whenever a class (like
[[manual.html#tek.ui.class.application : Application]],
[[manual.html#tek.ui.class.window : Window]] or
[[manual.html#tek.ui.class.text : Text]]) is accessed for the first
time, it will be loaded from {{tek/ui/class/}} in the file system.

Note that there is no button class in tekUI: a button is just a Text
element behaving like a button with a frame giving it the appearance
of a button. (We will later explain how you can write a button class
yourself, to save you some typing.) Also note that by placing an
underscore in front of a letter in its caption, we are creating a
keyboard shortcut for the [[manual.html#tek.ui.class.text : Text]]
element.

To quit, press the window's close button or the Escape key – closing
the [[manual.html#tek.ui.class.application : Application]]'s last
open window will cause the {{run}} method to return to its caller.

==( reactingoninput : 4.2. Reacting on input )==

There are different ways for reacting to presses on the "Hello,
World" button. The simplest method is to just place an {{onPress}}
function into the Text object, which will overwrite the
notification handler reacting on setting the {{Pressed}}
variable. This variable is set to '''true''' when a
[[manual.html#tek.ui.class.gadget : Gadget]] is getting activated,
and to '''false''' when it is getting released:

  #/usr/bin/env lua
  ui = require "tek.ui"
  ui.Application:new
  {
    Children =
    {
      ui.Window:new
      {
        Title = "Hello",
        Children =
        {
          ui.Text:new
          {
            Text = "_Hello, World!",
            Style = "button",
            Mode = "button",
            onPress = function(self, pressed)
              if pressed == false then
                print "Hello, World!"
              end
            end,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  }:run()

Another, more elobarate way is to equip the element with a
notification handler yourself, which may look like this:

  ...
  ui.Text:new
  {
    Text = "_Hello, World!",
    Style = "button",
    Mode = "button",
    Notifications =
    {
      ["Pressed"] =
      {
        [false] =
        {
          {
            ui.NOTIFY_SELF,
            ui.NOTIFY_FUNCTION,
            function(self)
              print "Hello, World!"
            end,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  ...

Even though notification handlers can be written in the same
expression as the rest of the application, we are now switching
to a different setup style, because the deep levels of
recursion are starting to interfere with clarity:

  #/usr/bin/env lua
  ui = require "tek.ui"
  app = ui.Application:new()
  win = ui.Window:new { Title = "Hello" }
  text = ui.Text:new {
    Text = "_Hello, World!",
    Style = "button",
    Mode = "button"
  }
  text:addNotify("Pressed", false, {
    ui.NOTIFY_SELF,
    ui.NOTIFY_FUNCTION,
    function(self)
      print "Hello, World!"
    end
  })
  win:addMember(text)
  app:addMember(win)
  app:run()

see also
[[Object:addNotify][manual.html#Object:addNotify]] for details on
notification handlers, and the
[[manual.html#tek.ui.class.gadget : Gadget]] class for some of the
possible actions to react on.

==( adhocclasses : 4.3. Ad-hoc setup of classes )==

To inherit properties and functionality from existing classes and to
reuse existing code consequently, it is often desirable to create new
classes yourself. There are different scopes in which new classes can
be useful:

 * Global classes are written as separate sources, located in the
 system-wide installation path under {{tek/ui/class}} and set up
 using a procedure as described in the [[#classsetup : class setup]]
 section.

 * Application classes are created in the same way, but they are
 located in the application's local program directory (also under
 {{tek/ui/class}}). They would also allow an application to be
 shipped with modified versions of the standard classes, as the
 application's local directory will be searched for classes first.

 * Another scope is inside the source code of an existing application
 or module. We might call this the 'ad-hoc' style, as new classes are
 often created out of a spontaneous need.

For the ad-hoc style, it is not necessary to create a new source.
For example, to derive a button class from the Text class:

  local Button = ui.Text:newClass { _NAME = "_button" }

By convention, ad-hoc classes can be named arbitrarily, but their
names should be prefixed with an underscore to distinguish them
from global classes.

From this point, the new class can be overridden, e.g. for
initializations which turn a Text into a Button:

  function Button.init(self)
    self.Style = "button"
    self.Mode = self.Mode or "button"
    return ui.Text.init(self)
  end

As shown in the example, we also passed the call on to our
superclass, which we expect to perform the missing initializations.

Finally, a new object from our new class can be created:

  button = Button:new { Text = "Hello, World!" }

Also refer to the [[manual.html#tek.class : Class reference]] and
the [[#classsetup : Class setup]] section for further information.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

=( developersguide : 5. tekUI developer's guide )=

==( debug : 5.1. Debug library )==

The debug library used throughout tekUI is
[[tek.lib.debug][manual.html#tek.lib.debug]]. The default debug
level is 10 ({{ERROR}}). To increase verbosity, set {{level}} to
a lower value, either by modifying {{tek/lib/debug.lua}}, or by
setting it after including the module:

  db = require "tek.lib.debug"
  db.level = db.INFO

See also the module's documentation for redirecting the output.

==( proxied : 5.2. Proxied object model )==

If you plan on extending existing classes or develop your own, you
should set the following configurable parameters in
[[tek.class][manual.html#tek.class]], the base class of all tekUI
classes:

  local PROXY = true
  local DEBUG = true

The {{PROXY}} option allows for intercepting read/write accesses to
objects, which will be harnessed by the {{DEBUG}} option for tracking
accesses to uninitialized class members; so whenever a '''nil'''
value is read from or written to an object, this causes {{tek.class}}
to bail out with an error and a meaningful message.

As a result, all member variables must be initialized during
{{new()}} or {{init()}} – or more specifically, before the class
metatable is attached and an object is becoming fully functional.
This will assist in keeping variables neatly together, and you won't
end up in a fluff of variables of limited scope and significance,
getting initialized at random places. This also means that you cannot
assign a distinct meaning to '''nil''' for a class member – you will
have to use '''false''' instead, or find another arrangement. This
convention of not using '''nil''' for class variables is found
throughout the whole of the tekUI framework.

Once your application is tested and ready for deployment, you can
disable {{PROXY}}, as this will improve performance and reduce memory
consumption.

==( classsetup : 5.3. Class setup )==

A class is usually set up in a prologue like this:

  local Gadget = require "tek.ui.class.gadget"
  module("tek.ui.class.button", tek.ui.class.gadget)
  _VERSION = "Button Gadget 1.0"
  local Button = _M

The second argument to {{module}} is the super class to derive the
new class from (see also [[tek.class][manual.html#tek.class]] for
details on how this is supposed to work). By convention, we then put
the module table (the class) into a local variable.

Finally, methods in the newly created class may look like this (note
that, thanks to the {{Button}} variable, the second example provides
an implicit {{self}}):

  function Button.new(class, self)
    ...
    return Gadget.new(class, self)
  end

  function Button:method()
    ...
    Gadget.method(self)
  end

Also, don't forget to add a {{_VERSION}} variable, as it will be used
by the documentation system – see also the next section.

==( classdoc : 5.4. Class documentation system )==

Don't stray off too far from the class setup described in the
previous section, as it contains valuable informations for tekUI's
documentation generator.

Most notably, the second argument to {{module}} should be written out
in full – in the example above, one might be tempted to use
{{Gadget}} instead of {{tek.ui.class.gadget}}; but then, the path
information would be lost for the source code parser, which tries to
assemble a self-contained class hierarchy from individual class /
child class relations.

=== Tokens for markup ===

Aside from the aforementioned {{module}} and {{_VERSION}} keys (see
section [[Class setup][#classsetup]]), the source code parser reacts
on the following tokens.

Long lines of dashes signify the beginnings and endings of comment
blocks that are subject to processing
[[markup notation][manual.html#tek.class.markup]], e.g.

  ----------------------------------------------------------------
  --  OVERVIEW::
  --    Area - implements margins, layouting and drawing
  ----------------------------------------------------------------

The other condition that must be met for the following text to appear
in the documentation is the recognition of either a definition (as
seen in the example) or function marker inside such a comment block.
The template for a definition is this:

  DEFINITION::

The function template:

  ret1, ret2, ... = function(arg1, arg2, ...): ...

The marker and the following text will then become part of the
documentation. (In other words, by avoiding these markers, it is also
possible to write comment blocks that do not show up in the
documentation.)

Functions inside classes will automatically receive a symbolic name
as their class prefix (from assigning the module table {{_M}} to a
local variable, see [[Class setup][#classsetup]]). Consecutively,
they can be cross-referenced using the following notations:

  Class:function()
  Class.function()

For further information, consult the sources in the
[[class hierarchy][manual.html]] as examples, and the source code
containing the
[[markup notation reference][manual.html#tek.class.markup]], which
can be found in {{tek.class.markup}}.
