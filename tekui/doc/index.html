		<div class="node"><h1><a name="about" id="about">1. About tekUI</a></h1>
			<p>
				tekUI is a small and freestanding graphical user interface (GUI)
				toolkit written in Lua and C. It was initially developed for the X
				Window System and can serve as a general-purpose GUI library for
				desktop applications.
			</p>
			<p>
				Its main focus is on rapid development of applications for
				custom-made devices, often with a custom appearance and under
				resource-constrained conditions, such as for embedded devices with a
				display controller.
			</p>
			<p>
				Being mostly written in the
				<a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua scripting language</a>, it is easily
				extensible with new user interface elements, which can later be
				rewritten in C. The creation of new styles and themes and fitting the
				software to a new device are equally simple.
			</p>
			<p>
				See below for a more detailed technical <a href="#overview">overview</a>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="node"><h2><a name="license" id="license">1.1. License</a></h2>
			<p>
				TekUI is free software under the same license as Lua itself: It can
				be used for both academic and commercial purposes at no cost, it
				qualifies as Open Source software and its license is compatible with
				the GPL. See <a href="copyright.html">copyright</a>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="node"><h2><a name="status" id="status">1.2. Status, requirements</a></h2>

				TekUI is in alpha stage of development. It should compile and run out
				of the box on Linux and FreeBSD. Display drivers are available for
				X11 and <a href="http://www.directfb.org/">DirectFB</a> (the latter being
				untested on FreeBSD). See also <a href="todo.html">TODO</a> for a list of
				known bugs and missing features, and <a href="#requirements">requirements</a> for a list of

			<p>
				TekUI is not a binding to an existing GUI library, and it makes no
				attempt to conform to the looks of a host's native GUI (although this
				can be emulated to a certain degree &#8211; see below for details). The
				implementation comes straight to the point, and it is comparatively
				fast and resource-friendly, despite its script-heavy nature. Among
				the benefits for developers are its transparency and modularity; in
				particular, custom interface elements can be created with little
				effort. Note, however, that the programming interfaces are nowhere
				complete and fully stable yet, so be prepared for structural and API
				changes.
			</p>

			<p>
				The only language currently supported for writing applications in is
				Lua, and application programmers will have to use existing Lua
				modules or create their own C bindings for communicating with their
				host. (Fortunately, creating C bindings is an easy and
				well-documented task in Lua, and the tekUI package contains numerous
				examples.)
			</p>
			<p>
				Our next development target is to fold the tekUI framework into a
				freestanding C library, which enables applications to create
				asynchronous GUI objects, communicating with their main program
				using an application-level protocol. From this, we envision the
				following benefits:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<ul>
					<li>
						GUIs integrate smoothly even into I/O-burdened applications
						(clients, servers)
					</li>
					<li>
						strict separation of GUI and functionality; the GUI runs in
						a thread or process of its own
					</li>
					<li>
						Faulty GUI application code, as it is written in a safe language,
						cannot corrupt the heap or otherwise crash the device, even if it
						is without a MMU.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Lua would continue to act as the toolkit's internal scripting
				language, which can be used for complex interconnections
				between GUI elements as well as simple application tasks.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="node"><h2><a name="themes" id="themes">2.3. Themes</a></h2>
			<p>
				The only admission to a more common appearance is that tekUI tries to
				import the color scheme found in a GTK+ configuration file. It can be
				conveniently created in the KDE configuration panel; thus, if you are
				using KDE and check the appropriate option, KDE, GTK+ and tekUI
				applications can all share the same color scheme.
			</p>
			<p>
				The current default theme tries to be as conservative and minimal as
				possible. Custom themes can be created by modifying (or deriving
				from) the Theme class.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="node"><h2><a name="clibrary" id="clibrary">2.4. C library</a></h2>
			<p>
				The C library is based on the <a href="http://www.teklib.org/">TEKlib</a> 
				middleware project. All required modules are contained in tekUI's
				source code distribution, to reduce the hassle of building and
				installing the software.
			</p>
			<p>
				The C library isolates from the host and provides a few
				performance-critical routines. Rendering and input handling are
				isolated in the form of display drivers, which allow for easy
				exchangeability. Display drivers currently supported are for X11 and
				<a href="http://www.directfb.org/">DirectFB</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Aside from the display driver interface, the C library features
				OS-like facilities such as portable threads and a timer device.
				Depending on your application and its kind of deployment, it can be
				extended with more input drivers, a virtual filesystem, file format
				codecs, etc.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="node"><h2><a name="objectjmodel" id="objectjmodel">2.5. Lua, C and object model</a></h2>
			<p>
				Regardless whether classes are written in Lua or C, they share a
				common, single-inheritance object model, which is determined by the
				Lua virtual machine and provides a referencing scheme and automatic
				memory management.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most user interface elements are currently implemented in Lua, which
				is beneficial for fast prototyping of custom classes and styles, and
				generally in early stages of development.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="node"><h2><a name="documentation" id="documentation">2.6. Documentation system</a></h2>
			<p>
				TekUI comes with a documentation generator supporting its own object
				model. It is capable of generating a function reference and
				hierarchical class index from specially crafted comments in the
				source code. To regenerate the full documentation, invoke
			</p>
<pre>
# make docs
</pre>
			<p>
				Note that you need
				<a href="http://www.keplerproject.org/luafilesystem/">LuaFileSystem</a> for
				the document generator to process the file system hierarchy.

		<div class="node"><h2><a name="requirements" id="requirements">3.1. Requirements</a></h2>
			<p>
				Development libraries alongside with their tested versions (as of
				this writing) are given below:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Lua-5.1.2
					</li>
					<li>
						libX11-1.1.3 (for the x11 driver)

					</li>
					<li>
						DirectFB-0.9.25.1 (for the dfb driver)
					</li>
				</ul>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				LibXft and fontconfig are needed for building the x11 driver, but
				tekUI falls back to the core X11 API if they are unavailable at
				runtime. Additionally, for the
				<a href="manual.html#tek.ui.class.dirlist">DirList</a> class to work, an
				installation of the
				<a href="http://www.keplerproject.org/luafilesystem/">LuaFileSystem</a> 
				package is needed.

		</div>
		<div class="node"><h2><a name="buildenv" id="buildenv">3.2. Adjusting the build environment</a></h2>
			<p>
				This release has been tested on and should compile and run out of the
				box on
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Ubuntu Linux 7.10
					</li>
					<li>
						FreeBSD 7.0

			<p>
				If building fails for you, you have to adjust the build environment,
				which is located in the <code>config</code> file on the topmost directory
				level. Supported build tools are <code>gmake</code> (common under Linux) and
				<code>pmake</code> (common under FreeBSD).
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>FreeBSD note</strong>: You need a Lua interpreter which is linked with
				the <code>-pthread</code> option, as tekUI is using multithreaded code
				in shared libraries, which are dynamically loaded by the interpreter.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="node"><h2><a name="building" id="building">3.3. Building</a></h2>
			<p>
				To see all build targets, type
			</p>
<pre>
# make help
</pre>

				The regular build procedure is invoked with
			</p>
<pre>
# make all
</pre>
		</div>
		<div class="node"><h2><a name="installation" id="installation">3.4. Installation</a></h2>
			<p>
				Please note that for the x11 driver, a system-wide installation of
				tekUI is not strictly required. Once it is built, it can be worked
				with and developed against, as long as you stay in the top-level
				directory of the distribution. All required modules and classes will
				be found if programs are started from there, e.g.:
			</p>
<pre>
# bin/demo.lua
</pre>
			<p>
				If staying in the top-level directory is not desirable, then tekUI
				must be installed globally. (The same applies if the dfb driver is
				used, as its fonts and cursors will be searched only globally.)
			</p>
			<p>
				By default, the installation paths are
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<ul>
					<li style="list-style-type: none">
						<code>/usr/local/lib/lua/5.1</code> 
					</li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none">
						<code>/usr/local/share/lua/5.1</code> 
					</li>
				</ul>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				It is not unlikely that this is different from what is common for
				your operating system, distribution or development needs, so be sure
				to adjust these paths in the <code>config</code> file. The installation is
				conveniently invoked with
			</p>
<pre>
# sudo make install

		<div class="node"><h1><a name="usersguide" id="usersguide">4. tekUI user's guide</a></h1>

				The GUI version of the &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program:
			</p>
<pre>
#/usr/bin/env lua
ui = require &quot;tek.ui&quot;
ui.Application:new
{
  Children =
  {
    ui.Window:new
    {
      Title = &quot;Hello&quot;,
      Children =
      {
        ui.Text:new
        {
          Text = &quot;_Hello, World!&quot;,
          Style = &quot;button&quot;,
          Mode = &quot;button&quot;,
        },
      },
    },
  },
}:run()
</pre>
			<p>
				As can be seen, tekUI allows a fully functional application to be
				written in a single nested expression. The
				<a href="manual.html#tek.ui">UI</a> library comes with an on-demand class
				loader, so whenever a class (like
				<a href="manual.html#tek.ui.class.application">Application</a>,
				<a href="manual.html#tek.ui.class.window">Window</a> or
				<a href="manual.html#tek.ui.class.text">Text</a>) is accessed for the first
				time, it will be loaded from <code>tek/ui/class/</code> in the file system.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that there is no button class in tekUI: a button is just a Text
				element behaving like a button with a frame giving it the appearance
				of a button. (We will later explain how you can write a button class
				yourself, to save you some typing.) Also note that by placing an
				underscore in front of a letter in its caption, we are creating a
				keyboard shortcut for the <a href="manual.html#tek.ui.class.text">Text</a> 
				element.
			</p>
			<p>
				To quit, press the window's close button or the Escape key &#8211; closing
				the <a href="manual.html#tek.ui.class.application">Application</a>'s last
				open window will cause the <code>run</code> method to return to its caller.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="node"><h2><a name="reactingoninput" id="reactingoninput">4.2. Reacting on input</a></h2>
			<p>
				There are different ways for reacting to presses on the &quot;Hello,
				World&quot; button. The simplest method is to just place an <code>onPress</code> 
				function into the Text object, which will overwrite the
				notification handler reacting on setting the <code>Pressed</code> 
				variable. This variable is set to <strong>true</strong> when a
				<a href="manual.html#tek.ui.class.gadget">Gadget</a> is getting activated,
				and to <strong>false</strong> when it is getting released:
			</p>
<pre>
#/usr/bin/env lua
ui = require &quot;tek.ui&quot;
ui.Application:new
{
  Children =
  {
    ui.Window:new
    {
      Title = &quot;Hello&quot;,
      Children =
      {
        ui.Text:new
        {
          Text = &quot;_Hello, World!&quot;,
          Style = &quot;button&quot;,
          Mode = &quot;button&quot;,
          onPress = function(self, pressed)
            if pressed == false then
              print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
            end
          end,
        },
      },
    },
  },
}:run()
</pre>
			<p>
				Another, more elobarate way is to equip the element with a
				notification handler yourself, which may look like this:
			</p>
<pre>
...
ui.Text:new
{
  Text = &quot;_Hello, World!&quot;,
  Style = &quot;button&quot;,
  Mode = &quot;button&quot;,
  Notifications =
  {
    &#091;&quot;Pressed&quot;&#093; =
    {
      &#091;false&#093; =
      {
        {
          ui.NOTIFY_SELF,
          ui.NOTIFY_FUNCTION,
          function(self)
            print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
          end,
        },
      },
    },
  },
},
...
</pre>
			<p>
				Even though notification handlers can be written in the same
				expression as the rest of the application, we are now switching
				to a different setup style, because the deep levels of
				recursion are starting to interfere with clarity:
			</p>
<pre>
#/usr/bin/env lua
ui = require &quot;tek.ui&quot;
app = ui.Application:new()
win = ui.Window:new { Title = &quot;Hello&quot; }
text = ui.Text:new {
  Text = &quot;_Hello, World!&quot;,
  Style = &quot;button&quot;,
  Mode = &quot;button&quot;
}
text:addNotify(&quot;Pressed&quot;, false, {
  ui.NOTIFY_SELF,
  ui.NOTIFY_FUNCTION,
  function(self)
    print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;
  end
})
win:addMember(text)
app:addMember(win)
app:run()
</pre>
			<p>
				see also
				<a href="manual.html#Object:addNotify">Object:addNotify</a> for details on
				notification handlers, and the
				<a href="manual.html#tek.ui.class.gadget">Gadget</a> class for some of the
				possible actions to react on.

		</div>
		<div class="node"><h2><a name="adhocclasses" id="adhocclasses">4.3. Ad-hoc setup of classes</a></h2>
			<p>
				To inherit properties and functionality from existing classes and to

						<code>tek/ui/class</code>). They would also allow an application to be
						shipped with modified versions of the standard classes, as the
						application's local directory will be searched for classes first.
					</li>
					<li>
						Another scope is inside the source code of an existing application
						or module. We might call this the 'ad-hoc' style, as new classes are
						often created out of a spontaneous need.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				For the ad-hoc style, it is not necessary to create a new source.
				For example, to derive a button class from the Text class:
			</p>
<pre>
local Button = ui.Text:newClass { _NAME = &quot;_button&quot; }
</pre>
			<p>
				By convention, ad-hoc classes can be named arbitrarily, but their
				names should be prefixed with an underscore to distinguish them
				from global classes.
			</p>
			<p>
				From this point, the new class can be overridden, e.g. for
				initializations which turn a Text into a Button:
			</p>
<pre>
function Button.init(self)
  self.Style = &quot;button&quot;
  self.Mode = self.Mode or &quot;button&quot;
  return ui.Text.init(self)
end
</pre>
			<p>
				As shown in the example, we also passed the call on to our
				superclass, which we expect to perform the missing initializations.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, a new object from our new class can be created:
			</p>
<pre>
button = Button:new { Text = &quot;Hello, World!&quot; }
</pre>
			<p>
				Also refer to the <a href="manual.html#tek.class">Class reference</a> and
				the <a href="#classsetup">Class setup</a> section for further information.

			<p>
				The debug library used throughout tekUI is
				<a href="manual.html#tek.lib.debug">tek.lib.debug</a>. The default debug
				level is 10 (<code>ERROR</code>). To increase verbosity, set <code>level</code> to
				a lower value, either by modifying <code>tek/lib/debug.lua</code>, or by
				setting it after including the module:
			</p>
<pre>
db = require &quot;tek.lib.debug&quot;
db.level = db.INFO
</pre>
			<p>
				See also the module's documentation for redirecting the output.

		<div class="node"><h2><a name="proxied" id="proxied">5.2. Proxied object model</a></h2>
			<p>
				If you plan on extending existing classes or develop your own, you
				should set the following configurable parameters in
				<a href="manual.html#tek.class">tek.class</a>, the base class of all tekUI
				classes:
			</p>
<pre>
local PROXY = true
local DEBUG = true
</pre>
			<p>
				The <code>PROXY</code> option allows for intercepting read/write accesses to
				objects, which will be harnessed by the <code>DEBUG</code> option for tracking
				accesses to uninitialized class members; so whenever a <strong>nil</strong> 
				value is read from or written to an object, this causes <code>tek.class</code> 
				to bail out with an error and a meaningful message.
			</p>
			<p>
				As a result, all member variables must be initialized during
				<code>new()</code> or <code>init()</code> &#8211; or more specifically, before the class
				metatable is attached and an object is becoming fully functional.
				This will assist in keeping variables neatly together, and you won't
				end up in a fluff of variables of limited scope and significance,
				getting initialized at random places. This also means that you cannot
				assign a distinct meaning to <strong>nil</strong> for a class member &#8211; you will
				have to use <strong>false</strong> instead, or find another arrangement. This
				convention of not using <strong>nil</strong> for class variables is found
				throughout the whole of the tekUI framework.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once your application is tested and ready for deployment, you can
				disable <code>PROXY</code>, as this will improve performance and reduce memory
				consumption.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="node"><h2><a name="classsetup" id="classsetup">5.3. Class setup</a></h2>
			<p>
				A class is usually set up in a prologue like this:
			</p>
<pre>
local Gadget = require &quot;tek.ui.class.gadget&quot;
module(&quot;tek.ui.class.button&quot;, tek.ui.class.gadget)
_VERSION = &quot;Button Gadget 1.0&quot;
local Button = _M
</pre>
			<p>
				The second argument to <code>module</code> is the super class to derive the
				new class from (see also <a href="manual.html#tek.class">tek.class</a> for
				details on how this is supposed to work). By convention, we then put
				the module table (the class) into a local variable.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, methods in the newly created class may look like this (note
				that, thanks to the <code>Button</code> variable, the second example provides
				an implicit <code>self</code>):
			</p>
<pre>
function Button.new(class, self)
  ...
  return Gadget.new(class, self)
end

function Button:method()
  ...
  Gadget.method(self)
end
</pre>
			<p>
				Also, don't forget to add a <code>_VERSION</code> variable, as it will be used
				by the documentation system &#8211; see also the next section.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="node"><h2><a name="classdoc" id="classdoc">5.4. Class documentation system</a></h2>
			<p>
				Don't stray off too far from the class setup described in the
				previous section, as it contains valuable informations for tekUI's
				documentation generator.
			</p>
			<p>
				Most notably, the second argument to <code>module</code> should be written out
				in full &#8211; in the example above, one might be tempted to use
				<code>Gadget</code> instead of <code>tek.ui.class.gadget</code>; but then, the path
				information would be lost for the source code parser, which tries to
				assemble a self-contained class hierarchy from individual class /
				child class relations.
			</p>
			<h3>
				Tokens for markup
			</h3>
			<p>
				Aside from the aforementioned <code>module</code> and <code>_VERSION</code> keys (see
				section <a href="#classsetup">Class setup</a>), the source code parser reacts
				on the following tokens.
			</p>
			<p>
				Long lines of dashes signify the beginnings and endings of comment
				blocks that are subject to processing
				<a href="manual.html#tek.class.markup">markup notation</a>, e.g.
			</p>
<pre>
----------------------------------------------------------------
--  OVERVIEW::
--    Area - implements margins, layouting and drawing
----------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>
			<p>
				The other condition that must be met for the following text to appear
				in the documentation is the recognition of either a definition (as
				seen in the example) or function marker inside such a comment block.
				The template for a definition is this:
			</p>
<pre>
DEFINITION::
</pre>
			<p>
				The function template:
			</p>
<pre>
ret1, ret2, ... = function(arg1, arg2, ...): ...
</pre>
			<p>
				The marker and the following text will then become part of the
				documentation. (In other words, by avoiding these markers, it is also
				possible to write comment blocks that do not show up in the
				documentation.)
			</p>
			<p>
				Functions inside classes will automatically receive a symbolic name
				as their class prefix (from assigning the module table <code>_M</code> to a
				local variable, see <a href="#classsetup">Class setup</a>). Consecutively,
				they can be cross-referenced using the following notations:
			</p>
<pre>
Class:function()
Class.function()
</pre>
			<p>
				For further information, consult the sources in the
				<a href="manual.html">class hierarchy</a> as examples, and the source code
				containing the
				<a href="manual.html#tek.class.markup">markup notation reference</a>, which
				can be found in <code>tek.class.markup</code>.
